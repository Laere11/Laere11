        "\n",
        "The evaluation metrics file is a critical component in the MatterGen workflow—it acts as a quantitative checkpoint that summarizes how well the generated materials meet the desired criteria. Here’s its significance in the big picture:\n",
        "\n",
        "Quality Assessment:\n",
        "It provides key numerical metrics (such as stability, novelty, uniqueness, and RMSD) that help you assess whether the generated structures are chemically plausible and stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance Benchmarking:\n",
        "By comparing the metrics (like energy values before and after relaxation), you can determine if the model is effectively generating materials that are closer to thermodynamic equilibrium, which is essential for synthesizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Guiding Iterations:\n",
        "The metrics help in making informed decisions about further refining the model, tuning parameters (e.g., diffusion guidance factor), or selecting candidates for more rigorous validation (e.g., using DFT).\n",
        "\n",
        "Reporting and Analysis:\n",
        "The metrics file serves as a standardized output that can be used to generate comprehensive reports, visualize property distributions, and compare model performance against benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the evaluation metrics file bridges the gap between raw model output and actionable insights, ensuring that the generated materials not only look good on paper (or in CIF files) but also hold up to rigorous physical and chemical standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 1st code example creates synthetic data just for demonstration purposes.  The 2nd code example uses mattersim but will need further development on the API calls to compute actual energy values."
