  <h1>Microsoft MatterGen in Material Science Research</h1>

  <h2>Installation and User Guide</h2>

  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p><strong>MatterGen</strong> is provided as an open‐source Python package (MIT‐licensed) on GitHub. It requires Python 3.10+ and is designed to run on Linux with a CUDA‐enabled GPU for best performance.</p>

  <h4>Key Installation Steps:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Install Prerequisites:</strong>
      <p>Use pip to install the lightweight environment manager <code>uv</code>.</p>
      <pre>pip install uv</pre>
      <p>(This tool simplifies managing the virtual environment and dependencies.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Set Up Environment:</strong>
      <p>Create and activate a Python 3.10 virtual environment. For example:</p>
      <pre>
uv venv .venv --python 3.10 
source .venv/bin/activate
      </pre>
      <p>This ensures MatterGen runs with the correct Python version.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Install MatterGen:</strong>
      <p>Inside the environment, install MatterGen in editable mode (run in the cloned MatterGen repository directory):</p>
      <pre>uv pip install -e .</pre>
      <p>This command will download and build all necessary Python dependencies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Large File Support:</strong>
      <p>The repository uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) to provide pre-trained models and datasets. Ensure Git LFS is installed before pulling the repo:</p>
      <pre>
git lfs install
git lfs pull
      </pre>
      <p>If LFS wasn’t installed initially, you can install it (e.g. <code>sudo apt install git-lfs</code>) and then run the pull command to retrieve the large files.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Note:</strong>
      <p>Running MatterGen on Apple Silicon Macs is experimental. It may work with the Apple GPU (Metal backend) by setting an environment variable:</p>
      <pre>export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1</pre>
      <p>(This is not officially supported.)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Getting Started (Usage)</h3>
  <p>Once installed, MatterGen provides command-line tools and pre-trained model checkpoints for immediate use.</p>

  <h4>Pre-trained Models</h4>
  <p>The repository includes a base generative model and several fine-tuned variants targeting specific material properties. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chemical system:</strong> Use the <code>chemical_system</code> model to constrain generation to specific elements (e.g., only Li-O compounds).</li>
    <li><strong>Crystal symmetry:</strong> Use the <code>space_group</code> model to generate structures with a given space group symmetry.</li>
    <li><strong>Electronic property:</strong> Use the <code>dft_band_gap</code> model to target a desired band gap value (from DFT calculations).</li>
    <li><strong>Magnetic property:</strong> Use the <code>dft_mag_density</code> model to target a specific magnetic moment density.</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanical property:</strong> Use the <code>ml_bulk_modulus</code> model to target a range of bulk modulus values.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-property models:</strong> For instance, <code>chemical_system_energy_above_hull</code> can jointly satisfy two constraints like composition plus thermodynamic stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These checkpoints are bundled in the <code>checkpoints/</code> directory and are also hosted on Hugging Face for easy downloading.</p>

  <h4>Generating New Materials</h4>
  <p><strong>MatterGen</strong> comes with a command-line tool <code>mattergen-generate</code> to sample new crystal structures.</p>

  <h5>Unconditional Generation</h5>
  <p>To generate, for example, 16 structures from the base model:</p>
  <pre>
export MODEL_NAME=mattergen_base  
export RESULTS_PATH=results/  
mattergen-generate $RESULTS_PATH --pretrained-name=$MODEL_NAME --batch_size=16 --num_batches=1
  </pre>
  <p>This command outputs a set of candidate crystal structures to the <code>results/</code> folder. Each generated structure is saved as a CIF file (inside a zip archive) and in an extended XYZ format. Optionally, MatterGen can save the full generation trajectory (the diffusion “denoising” sequence) for each structure.</p>

  <h5>Property-Conditioned Generation</h5>
  <p>To generate materials with desired properties, select the appropriate fine-tuned model and specify the target value. For example, to generate materials with a specific magnetic moment of approximately 0.15 using the magnetism-conditioned model:</p>
  <pre>
export MODEL_NAME=dft_mag_density  
export RESULTS_PATH=results/dft_mag_density/  
mattergen-generate $RESULTS_PATH --pretrained-name=$MODEL_NAME \
   --batch_size=16 \
   --properties_to_condition_on="{'dft_mag_density': 0.15}" \
   --diffusion_guidance_factor=2.0
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>--properties_to_condition_on</code> flag accepts one or multiple property targets as a Python dictionary.</li>
    <li>The guidance factor (γ) controls how strongly the generation is steered toward the target – higher values enforce the property more strictly at the cost of sample diversity.</li>
    <li>Similar prompts can target other properties (e.g., band gap, specific chemical compositions, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Evaluation and Post-Processing</h4>
  <p>After generation, MatterGen provides a utility to evaluate the novelty and stability of the generated structures. For example:</p>
  <pre>
mattergen-evaluate --structures_path=results/dft_mag_density/ --relax=True --save_as=results/dft_mag_density/metrics.json
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>This command relaxes each generated structure using an ML force field (MatterSim) and saves a JSON report of metrics such as uniqueness, novelty, and estimated formation energy.</li>
    <li>MatterSim provides an accelerated way to estimate stability without costly DFT calculations. However, final validation of promising candidates should be performed with high-accuracy methods like DFT.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Training and Customization</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced users can train new MatterGen models or fine-tune existing ones on custom data.</li>
    <li>The repository includes scripts to preprocess materials datasets and train the diffusion model from scratch.</li>
    <li>Microsoft provides a dataset of ~600k stable crystals (derived from Materials Project data) for training, but users can train on smaller or specialized datasets as needed.</li>
    <li>MatterGen supports a crystal structure prediction mode (CSP) where the composition is fixed during generation.</li>
    <li>Training is configured via Hydra-based config files, with support for multi-GPU training, gradient accumulation, and integration with experiment tracking (e.g., Weights & Biases).</li>
    <li>This flexibility allows researchers to adapt MatterGen to new domains (such as battery cathode materials or metal–organic frameworks) by providing the relevant training data and constraints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Using MatterGen to Guide Material Exploration with Prompts</h2>
  <p><strong>MatterGen</strong> represents a new paradigm in materials design by allowing users to directly guide the generation of novel candidate materials using property and composition prompts. Here is how the process works in detail:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Defining the Prompt:</strong>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>User inputs a high-level “design brief” specifying desired properties (e.g., target band gap, ionic conductivity, magnetic moment, chemical composition).</li>
        <li>Prompts may include multiple constraints that MatterGen uses to guide the generation process.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Conditioning the Diffusion Process:</strong>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>MatterGen uses a diffusion neural network that starts from random noise and iteratively “denoises” it into a candidate crystal structure.</li>
        <li>The prompt acts as a conditional input during each denoising step, steering the structure toward meeting the desired criteria.</li>
        <li>A guidance factor controls how strongly the prompt influences the generation process.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Generating Candidate Structures:</strong>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>The model produces a batch of candidate crystal structures, typically output as CIF or XYZ files.</li>
        <li>This generative approach explores a vast design space, including novel structures that may not exist in current databases.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Post-Generation Screening:</strong>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>Initial screening filters out candidates based on computed stability and novelty.</li>
        <li>Additional ML models or high-throughput DFT calculations may be used to further evaluate and refine the candidates.</li>
        <li>Users can iteratively refine the prompt based on screening feedback, gradually honing in on optimal materials.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Integration into Discovery Workflows:</strong>
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>The entire process forms an end-to-end design cycle: from high-level design brief to candidate generation, screening, and eventual experimental validation.</li>
        <li>This dramatically speeds up materials discovery, potentially reducing multi-year projects to weeks or days.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p><strong>MatterGen</strong> leverages generative AI and diffusion models to create novel crystal structures tailored to user-defined property prompts. By moving beyond traditional database screening, it opens up a vast design space, enabling rapid exploration of new materials. Its integration of property-conditioning, iterative refinement, and evaluation through simulation tools forms a powerful, end-to-end materials discovery platform with significant implications for battery technology, semiconductors, catalysts, and more.</p>
