The goal is to minimize the number of multiplication steps while ensuring that key submatrices that preserve accuracy are identified and maintained at a higher resolution.\n",

        "Hypothesis 1: Uniform Deep Tucker Decomposition with Post‑Processing Sensitivity Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Core Idea:\n",
        "Initially decompose the matrix extensively using Tucker decomposition—even if it means heavy subdivision into a small core tensor and associated factor matrices.\n",
        "Use a machine learning (ML) algorithm to evaluate the accuracy contribution of each decomposed submatrix (or module).\n",
        "How It Addresses the Problem:\n",
        "By treating every region equally at first, the approach sacrifices efficiency to obtain maximum resolution.\n",
        "A sensitivity analysis (using techniques analogous to feature importance in ML) then determines which submatrices are critical for maintaining the overall matrix product accuracy.\n",
        "Once key areas are identified, only those regions are “reconstructed” with less decomposition (i.e., a shallower Tucker factorization), while less critical areas remain highly decomposed, thereby reducing multiplication counts where possible.\n",

        "How It Addresses the Problem:\n",
        "The RL agent assigns a “weight” or importance score to each decomposed module by simulating different levels of decomposition and receiving feedback on accuracy losses.\n",
        "Over multiple iterations, the algorithm learns which blocks require minimal decomposition (to preserve accuracy) and which can be aggressively compressed.\n",
        "This adaptive strategy aims to blend the benefits of deep decomposition (for efficiency) with localized reconstruction (for accuracy), ultimately reducing the overall multiplication steps.\n",

        "Break the matrix into modules via a recursive Tucker decomposition—first at a coarse level, then further decomposing only the modules that pass a sensitivity threshold.\n",
        "Introduce a recursive feedback loop (via a meta-learning component) that reassesses the decomposition at each level based on an accuracy metric.\n",
        "How It Addresses the Problem:\n",
        "By recursively applying the decomposition only to modules that are “less critical” (i.e., have lower sensitivity scores), the algorithm limits the computational overhead.\n",
        "Modules critical for high accuracy are left closer to the original structure, ensuring that the overall multiplication is not compromised.\n",

        "Inspired by AlphaTensor’s success, it can discover nonintuitive decomposition patterns that humans might miss.\n",

        "Should the feedback loop rely solely on computed error metrics (from a known ground truth), or do you want to incorporate human-in-the-loop adjustments during training?\n",

This proposal outlines a theoretical framework that uses deep tensor decomposition (via Tucker) combined with an RL agent inspired by AlphaTensor’s exploratory methods to adaptively optimize the trade-off between multiplication efficiency and accuracy.\n",

        "CODE -\n",
        "Below is a simplified Python implementation that simulates our proposed reinforcement‐learning–inspired strategy. In this example, we start with a structured matrix (here generated as a Vandermonde matrix for polynomial fitting) and partition it into blocks. Each block is initially approximated via a Tucker-like (SVD-based) decomposition with a low rank (deep decomposition). In each iteration, we compare the reconstruction error of each block to a preset threshold and adjust the “decomposition level” (i.e. the rank) accordingly. This simulates our idea of “learning” which submatrices are critical for maintaining accuracy so that in subsequent loops those areas are decomposed less (using higher ranks)."

        "We generate a 16×16 Vandermonde matrix to simulate a structured matrix used in polynomial fitting.\n",

        "\n",
        "In each iteration, the algorithm checks the error of each block.\n",
        "If the error exceeds the threshold, the rank is increased for that block (less aggressive decomposition) to preserve accuracy.\n",
        "If the error is well below the threshold, the rank is decreased (allowing more aggressive decomposition to reduce multiplication cost).\n",
        "A simple cost model based on block size and rank is computed as a proxy for multiplication steps.\n",
        "Final Reconstruction:\n",
        "\n",
        "After several iterations, each block is reconstructed using its updated rank, and the overall reconstruction error of the entire matrix is reported.\n",
        "This code represents a first simplified proof-of-concept that you can further extend and refine. It implements a basic reinforcement learning–inspired adjustment (using rule-based updates) with a known ground truth (the original matrix) as feedback."
